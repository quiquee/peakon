# iOS Eddystone Scanner Sample Application

This is a simple iOS application that scans for Eddystone beacons and prints any sightings via
`NSLog` to the debug console.

There are both Objective-C and Swift versions of the sample. To switch between them, use
the "build target" dropdown in the upper left of Xcode.

This has been tested and developed on Xcode 6.x and is intended to target apps running
on iOS 8.x and greater.
